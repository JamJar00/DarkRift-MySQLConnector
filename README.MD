Hello!

These resources are free for you to use/copy/generally do what you like with.

You should be able to always find a Unity project of the latest version in the MySQLConnector Unity folder, download it and that's all you need!

To contributors...

Thanks! I don't have all that much time so other people contributing makes life so much easier! Please make sure that you follow these 2 rules if you want to be pulled into the main branch:
	1. Make sure there is always an up to date pdf of the documentation so everyone can read it.
	2. Make sure the Unity project is always working and up to date so people can easily download it.
